      "And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make\n",
      "ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make\n",
      "cakes upon the hearth.\n",
      "And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and\n",
      "good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n",
      "And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had\n",
      "dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under\n",
      "the tree, and they did eat.\n",
      "And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,\n",
      "Behold, in the tent.\n",
      "And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to\n",
      "the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.\n",
      "And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n",
      "Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and\n",
      "it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n",
      "Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am\n",
      "waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n",
      "And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,\n",
      "saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n",
      "Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I\n",
      "will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and\n",
      "Sarah shall have a son.\n",
      "Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.\n",
      "And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n",
      "And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and\n",
      "Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which\n",
      "I do;\n",
      "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty\n",
      "nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in\n",
      "him?\n",
      "For I know him, that he will command his children and his\n",
      "household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,\n",
      "to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon\n",
      "Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\n",
      "And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is\n",
      "great, and because their sin is very grievous;\n",
      "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether\n",
      "according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,\n",
      "I will know.\n",
      "And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward\n",
      "Sod but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n",
      "And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the\n",
      "righteous with the wicked?\n",
      "Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt\n",
      "thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty\n",
      "righteous that are therein?\n",
      "That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the\n",

      "the wicked, that be far from th Shall not the Judge of all\n",
      "the earth do right?\n",
      "And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within\n",
      "the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n",
      "And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon\n",
      "me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ash\n",
      "Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:\n",
      "wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,\n",
      "If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\n",
      "And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there\n",
      "shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for\n",
      "forty's sake.\n",
      "And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will\n",
      "spe Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he\n",
      "said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto\n",
      "the LO Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And\n",
      "he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.\n",

      "yet but this on Peradventure ten shall be found there. And\n",
      "he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\n",
      "And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing\n",
      "with Abrah and Abraham returned unto his place.\n",
      "And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the\n",
      "gate of Sod and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and\n",
      "he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;\n",
      "And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into\n",
      "your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,\n",
      "and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they\n",
      "said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n",
      "And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,\n",
      "and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did\n",
      "bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.\n",
      "But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of\n",
      "Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the\n",
      "people from every quart\n",
      "And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men\n",
      "which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that\n",
      "we may know them.\n",
      "And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door\n",
      "after him,\n",
      "And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n",
      "Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let\n",
      "me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as\n",
      "is good in your ey only unto these men do nothing; for\n",
      "therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.\n",
      "And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one\n",
      "fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a jud now\n",
      "will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed\n",
      "sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.\n",
      "But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the\n",
      "house to them, and shut to the door.\n",
      "And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with\n",
      "blindness, both small and gre so that they wearied\n",
      "themselves to find the door.\n",
      "And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in\n",
      "law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast\n",
      "in the city, bring them out of this pla\n",
      "For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is\n",
      "waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath\n",
      "sent us to destroy it.\n",
      "And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which\n",
      "married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this\n",
      "place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as\n",
      "one that mocked unto his sons in law.\n",
      "And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,\n",
      "saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are\n",
      "here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n",
      "And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and\n",
      "upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two\n",
      "daughters; the LORD being merciful unto h and they brought\n",
      "him forth, and set him without the city.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,\n",
      "that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,\n",
      "neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,\n",
      "lest thou be consumed.\n",
      "And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:\n",
      "Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and\n",
      "thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me\n",
      "in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest\n",
      "some evil take me, and I d\n",
      "Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little\n",
      "o Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and\n",
      "my soul shall live.\n",
      "And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning\n",
      "this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the\n",
      "which thou hast spoken.\n",
      "Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou\n",
      "be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called\n",
      "Zoar.\n",
      "The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n",
      "Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone\n",
      "and fire from the LORD out of heaven;\n",
      "And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the\n",
      "inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the\n",
      "ground.\n",
      "But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\n",
      "pillar of salt.\n",
      "And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he\n",
      "stood before the LO\n",
      "And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the\n",
      "land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the\n",
      "country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the\n",
      "plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the\n",
      "midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the\n",
      "which Lot dwelt.\n",
      "And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and\n",
      "his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zo\n",
      "and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.\n",
      "And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,\n",
      "and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after\n",
      "the manner of all the ear\n",
      "Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with\n",
      "him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "And they made their father drink wine that night: and the\n",
      "firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived\n",
      "not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said\n",
      "unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my fath\n",
      "let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,\n",
      "and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the\n",
      "younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she\n",
      "lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their\n",
      "father.\n",
      "And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the\n",
      "same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\n",
      "And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name\n",
      "Benam the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto\n",
      "this day.\n",
      "And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,\n",
      "and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n",
      "And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and\n",
      "Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n",
      "But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to\n",
      "him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou\n",
      "hast taken; for she is a man's wife.\n",
      "But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt\n",
      "thou slay also a righteous nation?\n",
      "Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she\n",
      "herself said, He is my broth in the integrity of my heart\n",
      "and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n",
      "And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst\n",
      "this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee\n",
      "from sinning against  therefore suffered I thee not to\n",
      "touch her.\n",
      "Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,\n",
      "and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt li and if thou\n",
      "restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,\n",
      "and all that are thine.\n",
      "Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all\n",
      "his servants, and told all these things in their ea and the\n",
      "men were sore afraid.\n",
      "Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast\n",
      "thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou\n",
      "hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast\n",
      "done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n",
      "And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou\n",
      "hast done this thing?\n",
      "And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is\n",
      "not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n",
      "And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my\n",
      "father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my\n",
      "wife.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my\n",
      "father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness\n",
      "which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall\n",
      "come, say of me, He is my brother.\n",
      "And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\n",
      "womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him\n",
      "Sarah his wife.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell\n",
      "where it pleaseth thee.\n",
      "And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a\n",
      "thousand pieces of silv behold, he is to thee a covering of\n",
      "the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all oth\n",
      "thus she was reproved.\n",
      "So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his\n",
      "wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\n",
      "For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of\n",
      "Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n",
      "And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did\n",
      "unto Sarah as he had spoken.\n",
      "For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at\n",
      "the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n",
      "And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,\n",
      "whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n",
      "And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as\n",
      "God had commanded him.\n",
      "And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was\n",
      "born unto him.\n",
      "And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that\n",
      "hear will laugh with me.\n",
      "And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah\n",
      "should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in\n",
      "his old age.\n",
      "And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great\n",
      "feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n",
      "And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had\n",
      "born unto Abraham, mocking.\n",
      "Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and\n",
      "her s for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with\n",
      "my son, even with Isaac.\n",
      "And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of\n",
      "his son.\n",
      "And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight\n",
      "because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that\n",
      "Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in\n",
      "Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n",
      "And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,\n",
      "because he is thy seed.\n",
      "And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and\n",
      "a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her\n",
      "shoulder, and the child, and sent her aw and she departed,\n",
      "and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n",
      "And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child\n",
      "under one of the shrubs.\n",
      "And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way\n",
      "off, as it were a bow sh for she said, Let me not see the\n",
      "death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up\n",
      "her voice, and wept.\n",
      "And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God\n",
      "called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth\n",
      "thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad\n",
      "where he is.\n",
      "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will\n",
      "make him a great nation.\n",
      "And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she\n",
      "went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad\n",
      "drink.\n",
      "And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the\n",
      "wilderness, and became an archer.\n",
      "And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took\n",
      "him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol\n",
      "the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God\n",
      "is with thee in all that thou doe\n",
      "Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not\n",
      "deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's s\n",
      "but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou\n",
      "shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n",
      "And Abraham said, I will swear.\n",
      "And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,\n",
      "which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n",
      "And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;\n",
      "neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to\n",
      "day.\n",
      "And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;\n",
      "and both of them made a covenant.\n",
      "And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n",
      "And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe\n",
      "lambs which thou hast set by themselves?\n",
      "And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my\n",
      "hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged\n",
      "this well.\n",
      "Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they\n",
      "sware both of them.\n",
      "Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose\n",
      "up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they\n",
      "returned into the land of the Philistines.\n",
      "And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on\n",
      "the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n",
      "And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n",
      "And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\n",
      "Abraham, and said unto him, Abrah and he said, Behold, here\n",
      "I am.\n",
      "And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou\n",
      "lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him\n",
      "there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I\n",
      "will tell thee of.\n",
      "And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,\n",
      "and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and\n",
      "clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went\n",
      "unto the place of which God had told him.\n",
      "Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the\n",
      "place afar off.\n",
      "And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the\n",
      "ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come\n",
      "again to you.\n",
      "And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it\n",
      "upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a\n",
      "knife; and they went both of them together.\n",
      "And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:\n",
      "and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire\n",
      "and the wo but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\n",
      "And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for\n",
      "a burnt offeri so they went both of them together.\n",
      "And they came to the place which God had told him of; and\n",
      "Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and\n",
      "bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n",
      "And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to\n",
      "slay his son.\n",
      "And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and\n",
      "said, Abraham, Abrah and he said, Here am I.\n",

      "And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.\n",
      "And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me\n",
      "bless and she called his name Asher.\n",
      "And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found\n",
      "mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.\n",
      "Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's\n",
      "mandrakes.\n",
      "And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast\n",
      "taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's\n",
      "mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with\n",
      "thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.\n",
      "And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went\n",
      "out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for\n",
      "surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay\n",
      "with her that night.\n",
      "And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob\n",
      "the fifth son.\n",
      "And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given\n",
      "my maiden to my husba and she called his name Issachar.\n",
      "And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n",
      "And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will\n",
      "my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six so\n",
      "and she called his name Zebulun.\n",
      "And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n",
      "And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and\n",
      "opened her womb.\n",
      "And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken\n",
      "away my reproa\n",
      "And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add\n",
      "to me another son.\n",
      "And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob\n",
      "said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own\n",
      "place, and to my country.\n",
      "Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,\n",
      "and let me  for thou knowest my service which I have done\n",
      "thee.\n",
      "And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour\n",
      "in thine eyes, tar for I have learned by experience that\n",
      "the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.\n",
      "And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n",
      "And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and\n",
      "how thy cattle was with me.\n",
      "For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is\n",
      "now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee\n",
      "since my comi and now when shall I provide for mine own\n",
      "house also?\n",
      "And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou\n",
      "shalt not give me any thi if thou wilt do this thing for\n",
      "me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.\n",
      "I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence\n",
      "all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle\n",
      "among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goa\n",
      "and of such shall be my hire.\n",
      "So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when\n",
      "it shall come for my hire before thy fa every one that is\n",
      "not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the\n",
      "sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.\n",
      "And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy\n",
      "word.\n",
      "And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and\n",
      "spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,\n",
      "and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown\n",
      "among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n",
      "And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and\n",
      "Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n",
      "And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and\n",
      "chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the\n",
      "white appear which was in the rods.\n",
      "And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in\n",
      "the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to\n",
      "drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n",
      "And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\n",
      "cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n",
      "And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the\n",
      "flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock\n",
      "of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put\n",
      "them not unto Laban's cattle.\n",
      "And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did\n",
      "conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the\n",
      "cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the\n",
      "rods.\n",
      "But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the\n",
      "feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n",
      "And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and\n",
      "maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n",
      "And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath\n",
      "taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was\n",
      "our father's hath he gotten all this glory.\n",
      "And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was\n",
      "not toward him as before.\n",
      "And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy\n",
      "fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n",
      "And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto\n",
      "his flock,\n",
      "And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it\n",
      "is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been\n",
      "with me.\n",
      "And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n",
      "And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten\n",
      "times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n",
      "If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the\n",
      "cattle bare speckl and if he said thus, The ringstraked\n",
      "shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n",
      "Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given\n",
      "them to me.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,\n",
      "that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,\n",
      "the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,\n",
      "speckled, and grisled.\n",
      "And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:\n",
      "And I said, Here am I.\n",
      "And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams\n",
      "which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and\n",
      "grisl for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n",
      "I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and\n",
      "where thou vowedst a vow unto  now arise, get thee out from\n",
      "this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n",
      "And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet\n",
      "any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?\n",
      "Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and\n",
      "hath quite devoured also our money.\n",
      "For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that\n",
      "is ours, and our children now then, whatsoever God hath\n",
      "said unto thee, do.\n",
      "Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon\n",
      "camels;\n",
      "And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he\n",
      "had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in\n",
      "Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of\n",
      "Canaan.\n",
      "And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the\n",
      "images that were her father's.\n",
      "And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he\n",
      "told him not that he fled.\n",
      "So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed\n",
      "over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n",
      "And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n",
      "And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven\n",
      "days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n",
      "And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said\n",
      "unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good\n",
      "or bad.\n",
      "Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in\n",
      "the mou and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of\n",
      "Gilead.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\n",
      "stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as\n",
      "captives taken with the sword?\n",
      "Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from\n",
      "me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away\n",
      "with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n",
      "And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?\n",
      "thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.\n",
      "It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\n",
      "your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed\n",
      "that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n",
      "And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\n",
      "longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou\n",
      "stolen my gods?\n",
      "And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:\n",
      "for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\n",
      "daughters from me.\n",
      "With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:\n",
      "before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and\n",
      "take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen\n",
      "them.\n",
      "And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and\n",
      "into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then\n",
      "went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\n",
      "Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's\n",
      "furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,\n",
      "but found them not.\n",
      "And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that\n",
      "I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon\n",
      "me. And he searched but found not the images.\n",
      "And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\n",
      "and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that\n",
      "thou hast so hotly pursued after me?\n",
      "Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found\n",
      "of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and\n",
      "thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\n",
      "This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\n",
      "goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock\n",
      "have I not eaten.\n",
      "That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\n",
      "the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether\n",
      "stolen by day, or stolen by night.\n",
      "Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost\n",
      "by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n",
      "Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\n",
      "fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy\n",
      "catt and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n",
      "Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear\n",
      "of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now\n",
      "empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my\n",
      "hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\n",
      "And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\n",
      "daughters, and these children are my children, and these\n",
      "cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mi and\n",
      "what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their\n",
      "children which they have born?\n",
      "Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;\n",
      "and let it be for a witness between me and thee.\n",
      "And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n",
      "And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\n",
      "stones, and made an he and they did eat there upon the\n",
      "heap.\n",
      "And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it\n",
      "Galeed.\n",
      "And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee\n",
      "this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;\n",
      "And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,\n",
      "when we are absent one from another.\n",
      "If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take\n",
      "other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God\n",
      "is witness betwixt me and thee.\n",
      "And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\n",
      "pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and th\n",
      "This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will\n",
      "not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass\n",
      "over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.\n",
      "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\n",
      "father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his\n",
      "father Isaac.\n",
      "Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\n",
      "brethren to eat bre and they did eat bread, and tarried all\n",
      "night in the mount.\n",
      "And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons\n",
      "and his daughters, and blessed th and Laban departed, and\n",
      "returned unto his place.\n",
      "And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n",
      "And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he\n",
      "called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n",
      "And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto\n",
      "the land of Seir, the country of Edom.\n",
      "And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my\n",
      "lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with\n",
      "Laban, and stayed there until n\n",
      "And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and\n",
      "womenservan and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may\n",
      "find grace in thy sight.\n",
      "And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\n",
      "brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four\n",
      "hundred men with him.\n",
      "Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided\n",
      "the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and\n",
      "the camels, into two bands;\n",
      "And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then\n",
      "the other company which is left shall escape.\n",
      "And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my\n",
      "father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy\n",
      "country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with th\n",
      "I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all\n",
      "the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with\n",
      "my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two\n",
      "bands.\n",
      "Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\n",
      "hand of Es for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,\n",
      "and the mother with the children.\n",
      "And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\n",
      "as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for\n",
      "multitude.\n",
      "And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which\n",
      "came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;\n",
      "Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,\n",
      "and twenty rams,\n",
      "Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten\n",
      "bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\n",
      "And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every\n",
      "drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over\n",
      "before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.\n",
      "And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\n",
      "meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and\n",
      "whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?\n",
      "Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a\n",
      "present sent unto my lord Es and, behold, also he is behind\n",
      "us.\n",
      "And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\n",
      "followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak\n",
      "unto Esau, when ye find him.\n",
      "And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.\n",
      "For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth\n",
      "before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he\n",
      "will accept of me.\n",
      "So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\n",
      "night in the company.\n",
      "And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\n",
      "womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford\n",
      "Jabbok.\n",
      "And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\n",
      "that he had.\n",
      "And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\n",
      "until the breaking of the day.\n",
      "And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\n",
      "the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was\n",
      "out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n",
      "And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I\n",
      "will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n",
      "And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n",
      "And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but\n",
      "Isra for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,\n",
      "and hast prevailed.\n",
      "And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.\n",
      "And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?\n",
      "And he blessed him there.\n",
      "And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen\n",
      "God face to face, and my life is preserved.\n",
      "And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he\n",
      "halted upon his thigh.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which\n",
      "shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this d\n",
      "because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew\n",
      "that shrank.\n",
      "And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau\n",
      "came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the\n",
      "children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two\n",
      "handmaids.\n",
      "And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah\n",
      "and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n",
      "And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the\n",
      "ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n",
      "And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his\n",
      "neck, and kissed h and they wept.\n",
      "And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\n",
      "and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children\n",
      "which God hath graciously given thy servant.\n",
      "Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and\n",
      "they bowed themselves.\n",
      "And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed\n",
      "themselv and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they\n",
      "bowed themselves.\n",
      "And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?\n",
      "And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast\n",
      "unto thyself.\n",
      "And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in\n",
      "thy sight, then receive my present at my ha for therefore I\n",
      "have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and\n",
      "thou wast pleased with me.\n",
      "Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;\n",
      "because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have\n",
      "enough. And he urged him, and he took it.\n",
      "And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I\n",
      "will go before thee.\n",
      "And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are\n",
      "tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with  and\n",
      "if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n",
      "Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I\n",
      "will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before\n",
      "me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my\n",
      "lord unto Seir.\n",
      "And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk\n",
      "that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find\n",
      "grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n",
      "And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and\n",
      "made booths for his catt therefore the name of the place is\n",
      "called Succoth.\n",
      "And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the\n",

      "interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n",
      "And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to\n",
      "him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;\n",
      "And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it\n",
      "budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof\n",
      "brought forth ripe grap\n",
      "And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and\n",
      "pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into\n",
      "Pharaoh's hand.\n",
      "And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:\n",
      "The three branches are three da\n",
      "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and\n",
      "restore thee unto thy pla and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's\n",

      "butler.\n",
      "But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\n",
      "kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto\n",
      "Pharaoh, and bring me out of this hou\n",
      "For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:\n",
      "and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into\n",
      "the dungeon.\n",
      "When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\n",
      "said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had\n",
      "three white baskets on my he\n",
      "And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of\n",
      "bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the\n",
      "basket upon my head.\n",
      "And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\n",
      "there The three baskets are three days:\n",
      "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off\n",
      "thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat\n",
      "thy flesh from off thee.\n",
      "And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's\n",
      "birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servan and he\n",
      "lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker\n",
      "among his servants.\n",
      "And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;\n",
      "and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's ha\n",
      "But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n",
      "And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\n",
      "dream and, behold, he stood by the river.\n",
      "And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well\n",
      "favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n",
      "And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\n",
      "river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other\n",
      "kine upon the brink of the river.\n",
      "And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\n",
      "well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n",
      "And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven\n",
      "ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n",
      "And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\n",
      "sprung up after them.\n",
      "And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\n",
      "And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n",
      "And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was\n",
      "troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of\n",
      "Egypt, and all the wise men there and Pharaoh told them his\n",
      "dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto\n",
      "Pharaoh.\n",
      "Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do\n",
      "remember my faults this d\n",
      "Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the\n",
      "captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief bak\n",
      "And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each\n",
      "man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n",
      "And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to\n",
      "the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted\n",
      "to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did\n",
      "interpret.\n",
      "And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he\n",
      "restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\n",
      "Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him\n",
      "hastily out of the dunge and he shaved himself, and changed\n",
      "his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and\n",
      "there is none that can interpret  and I have heard say of\n",
      "thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.\n",
      "And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God\n",
      "shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood\n",
      "upon the bank of the riv\n",
      "And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,\n",
      "fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a mead\n",

      "very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all\n",
      "the land of Egypt for badne\n",
      "And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first\n",
      "seven fat ki\n",
      "And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that\n",
      "they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at\n",
      "the beginning. So I awoke.\n",
      "And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one\n",
      "stalk, full and go\n",
      "And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the\n",
      "east wind, sprung up after th\n",
      "And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told\n",
      "this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare\n",
      "it to me.\n",
      "And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God\n",
      "hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n",
      "The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears\n",
      "are seven yea the dream is one.\n",
      "And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after\n",
      "them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with\n",
      "the east wind shall be seven years of famine.\n",
      "This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God\n",
      "is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\n",
      "Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all\n",
      "the land of Egy\n",

      "all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and\n",
      "the famine shall consume the land;\n",
      "And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of\n",
      "that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.\n",
      "And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is\n",
      "because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly\n",
      "bring it to pass.\n",
      "Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,\n",
      "and set him over the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the\n",
      "land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the\n",
      "seven plenteous years.\n",
      "And let them gather all the food of those good years that\n",
      "come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them\n",
      "keep food in the cities.\n",
      "And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\n",
      "years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the\n",

      "And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\n",
      "of all his servants.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as\n",
      "this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?\n",
      "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed\n",
      "thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou a\n",
      "Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall\n",
      "all my people be rul only in the throne will I be greater\n",
      "than thou.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all\n",
      "the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon\n",
      "Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and\n",
      "put a gold chain about his neck;\n",
      "And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;\n",
      "and they cried before him, Bow the kn and he made him ruler\n",
      "over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee\n",
      "shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of\n",
      "Egypt.\n",
      "And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave\n",
      "him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.\n",
      "And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh\n",

      "Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by\n",
      "handfuls.\n",
      "And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were\n",
      "in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the citi the\n",
      "food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he\n",
      "up in the same.\n",
      "And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,\n",
      "until he left numbering; for it was without number.\n",
      "And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine\n",
      "came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On\n",
      "bare unto him.\n",

      "house.\n",
      "And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath\n",

      "said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land\n",
      "ye are come.\n",
      "And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy\n",
      "servants come.\n",
      "We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are\n",
      "no spies.\n",
      "And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the\n",
      "land ye are come.\n",
      "And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of\n",
      "one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is\n",
      "this day with our father, and one is not.\n",
      "And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,\n",

      "be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether\n",
      "there be any truth in y or else by the life of Pharaoh\n",
      "surely ye are spies.\n",

      "But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words\n",
      "be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n",
      "And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning\n",
      "our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he\n",
      "besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress\n",

      "And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,\n",
      "it is even in my sa and their heart failed them, and they\n",

      "done unto us?\n",
      "And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,\n",
      "and told him all that befell unto them; saying,\n",
      "The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and\n",
      "took us for spies of the country.\n",
      "And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n",
      "We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the\n",
      "youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n",

      "And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of\n",
      "our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another\n",

      "for these men shall dine with me at noon.\n",
      "And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men\n",
      "into Joseph's house.\n",

      "And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:\n",
      "we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n",
      "And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God\n",
      "of your father, hath given you treasure in your sac I had\n",
      "your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.\n",
      "And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them\n",
      "water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses\n",
      "provender.\n",

      "well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?\n",
      "And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,\n",
      "he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made\n",
      "obeisance.\n",
      "And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his\n",
      "mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom\n",
      "ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my\n",
      "son.\n",
      "And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his\n",
      "broth and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his\n",
      "chamber, and wept there.\n",
      "And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,\n",
      "and said, Set on bread.\n",
      "And they set on for him by himself, and for them by\n",
      "themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by\n",
      "themselv because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the\n",

      "birthright, and the youngest according to his you and the\n",
      "men marvelled one at another.\n",
      "And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but\n",
      "Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And\n",
      "they drank, and were merry with him.\n",
      "And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the\n",
      "men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put\n",
      "every man's money in his sack's mouth.\n",
      "And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the\n",
      "youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word\n",
      "that Joseph had spoken.\n",
      "As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they\n",
      "and their asses.\n",
      "And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,\n",
      "Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and\n",
      "when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye\n",
      "rewarded evil for good?\n",
      "Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed\n",
      "he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n",
      "And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n",
      "And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?\n",
      "God forbid that thy servants should do according to this\n",
      "thi\n",
      "Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we\n",
      "brought again unto thee out of the land of Cana how then\n",
      "should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?\n",
      "With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,\n",
      "and we also will be my lord's bondmen.\n",
      "And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he\n",
      "with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be\n",
      "blameless.\n",
      "Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,\n",
      "and opened every man his sack.\n",
      "And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the\n",
      "younge and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n",
      "Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and\n",
      "returned to the city.\n",
      "And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was\n",
      "yet the and they fell before him on the ground.\n",
      "And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have\n",
      "done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?\n",
      "And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we\n",
      "speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the\n",
      "iniquity of thy servan behold, we are my lord's servants,\n",
      "both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.\n",
      "And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in\n",
      "whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as\n",
      "for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\n",
      "Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy\n",
      "servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let\n",
      "not thine anger burn against thy serva for thou art even as\n",
      "Pharaoh.\n",
      "My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a\n",
      "brother?\n",
      "And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a\n",
      "child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,\n",
      "and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n",
      "And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,\n",
      "that I may set mine eyes upon him.\n",
      "And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for\n",
      "if he should leave his father, his father would die.\n",
      "And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest\n",
      "brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n",
      "And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my\n",
      "father, we told him the words of my lord.\n",
      "And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n",
      "And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be\n",
      "with us, then will we go do for we may not see the man's\n",
      "face, except our youngest brother be with us.\n",
      "And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife\n",
      "bare me two so\n",
      "And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in\n",
      "pieces; and I saw him not sin\n",
      "And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye\n",
      "shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the\n",
      "lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the\n",
      "lad's life;\n",
      "It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with\n",
      "us, that he will d and thy servants shall bring down the\n",
      "gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,\n",
      "saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the\n",
      "blame to my father for ever.\n",
      "Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of\n",
      "the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his\n",
      "brethren.\n",
      "For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with\n",
      "me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my\n",
      "father.\n",
      "Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that\n",
      "stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.\n",
      "And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself\n",
      "known unto his brethren.\n",
      "And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh\n",
      "heard.\n",
      "And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father\n",
      "yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were\n",
      "troubled at his presence.\n",
      "And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray\n",
      "you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your\n",

      "So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he\n",

      "all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my\n",
      "father hither.\n",
      "And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and\n",
      "Benjamin wept upon his neck.\n",
      "Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and\n",

      "To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to\n",
